# Conclusion

With these basic principles and examples, you can get started creating impactful sleek, modern data visualizations that will help convey your message efficiently and effectively.

Think about who your audience is, what they know and what they *need* to know. Keep asking yourself and others **"What's the Message?"** throughout the data visualization process. Your focus should be on those things that best convey the message.

Use the correct visual that matches the type of data and message. Line graphs are good for time series and (smoothed) distributions. Bar graphs have many uses, including comparing values by category, parts-to-whole with stacked bars, and...
Use horizontal bar graphs when the data labels are long, since we read horizontally (not vertically or on a 45-degreee angle).

Most graphs are overly complicated and cluttered with extraneous axis lines, tickmarks, and borders. Remove everything that doesn't help tell the message or gray it out to deemphasize. Let the data itself be the star of the show.

Make the data pop for your audience. Draw attention to the most important data using length, width, shape, color, and other techniques. Use Preattentive Attributes when choosing your visual (use length and relative position in 2D, rather than area and volume, for example). Use Gestalt Principles, which reflect the science of how the human eye perceives lines, bars, dots, etc. in space.

Be creative and have fun creating data visualization that will enlighten your audience and convey your message!
