# Conclusion

We've offered basic principles and examples to get you started creating impactful, sleek, modern data vis that will help convey your message efficiently and effectively.

Think about who your audience is, what they know and what they *need* to know. Keep asking yourself and others **"What's the Message?"** throughout the data vis process. This is a simple way to ensure that the focus is on the most important things to convey the message.

Use the right visual for the right type of data and message. Line graphs are good for time series and (smoothed) distributions. Bar graphs have many uses including comparing values by category and parts-to-whole with stacked bars. Horizontal bar graphs are good to use when the data labels are long since we read horizontally (not vertically or on a 45-degree angle).

Most graphs are overly complicated and cluttered with extraneous axis lines, tickmarks, and borders. Remove that which doesn't help tell the message, or at least gray it out to de-emphasize nonessential elements, letting the data itself be the star of the show.

Make the data pop out for your audience. Draw attention to the most important data using length, width, shape, color, and other techniques to distinguish the data. Use Preattentive Attributes in choosing your visual (use length and relative position in 2D, rather than area and volume, for example). Use Gestalt principles, which reflect the science of how the human eye perceives lines, bars, dots, etc. in space. e.g. the eye will notice things that are different.

Be creative and have fun creating data vis that will enlighten your audience and convey your message!
