# Consider the audience

When we create data visualizations to present quantitative information, instead of jumping straight to the designing stage, we should first understand "the context for the need to communicate" [@Knaflic]. The context can be split into two parts: the target audience and the intended message.

## Who is the audience?

### What is their role? What is their background?

Actuaries can use different kinds of visualizations to communicate actuarial findings and recommendations to various groups such as other actuaries, regulators, underwriters, brokers, executives and many more. A common pitfall is that we tend to generalize the target audience group to "internal and external stakeholders" or "anyone who may be interested" [@Knaflic]. These generic ("internal or external") groups include audiences with different roles and backgrounds. 

We must tailor the visualizations to a specific audience group to maximize the effectiveness of the message. To narrow the target audience group, Knaflic recommends identifying the decision maker. Ask yourself: "What information and what considerations drive the decision-maker"? Asking the question: "Who is the audience?" may also determine whether the presentation should be live/interactive or whether it is appropriate to send the audience the visualizations to view on their own.

### How technical are they? What do they already know?

After defining the target audience group, the presenter should know the audience's technical knowledge level. Without careful attention to data visualization, actuarial analyses can be too technical and difficult to comprehend for non-actuarial groups to comprehend fully, especially with the large collection of actuarial acronyms, terms, and methods. When designing a visualization for non-actuarial audience, consider putting yourself in their shoes by asking yourself "What is their perspective?" and "What do they know?". Actuarial audiences will also understand and absorb the information more effectively if it is presented simply, no matter how technical the material, with their knowledge level in mind.

## "What is the message?"

When crafting visuals, a content creator should continually ask themselves and fellow workers **"What is the message?"**. Asking this question and the other related questions below helps refine the content, complexity, and nature of visual presentations.

### What does the audience need know to influence the decision?

After we understand the target audience's role and technical background, we should think about how to make the visualization relevant for the audience. In other words, what information needs to be included in the visualization to help the audience make decisions. Knaflic clarifies an important disctinction between _exploratory_ analysis and _explanatory_ analysis. Exploratory analysis refers to the preliminary work we do "to understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others" [@Knaflic], and explanatory analysis refers to the "specific thing you want to explain" or the "specific story you want to tell" [@Knaflic]. We should focus on the **explanatory** aspect of our work in the visualizations to influence the audience's decision. For example, an underwriter may prefer to see how a change in the selected tail factor affects the bottom line loss ratio, whereas another actuary may want to see all of the indicated tail factors underlying the change in selected tail factor. Think about what affects your audience and motivates their decisions.

### How much detail do they really need? How much will suit them?

According to Knaflic, the communication mechanism determines how much control the presenter has on the way the target audience consumes the information, which in turn determines the level of detail a visualization needs [@Knaflic]. For example, during a live presentation, the presenter has the most control over the flow of the storytelling process. If the audience has a question about a particular point, the presenter can answer right away and provide more details in person, so the **visualizations in the presentation deck do not need to be over-filled with details**. However, for written documents to be viewed independently by the audience, the author has less control over when and how the audience will interpret the visualization, so even more consideration and care may be needed in creating visualizations to communicate the intended message. Our tendency may be to provide more detail, but that may confuse the message rather than clarify.

### What is the audience supposed to DO with the information?

It's important to remember that after we inform the audience about key insights on a topic, we should guide them to take action(s) to resolve it. We can explicitly state the next steps, provide recommendations, or encourage discussions for situations where the next step is unclear [@Knaflic]. It is reasonable to include an action statement _within_ the title or visual.
