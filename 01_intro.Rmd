# Definition of “Data Visualization”

Visualization images are everywhere. Data and information is becoming more accessible all the time. To absorb value from all this data, we must incorporate the concept of "data visualization". **Simply put, data visualization = data represented by a visual image**. Some of the most common and basic data visualization applications include bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots. The general design concepts in this publicaion apply to any type of data visualization in any medium (e.g. website, software tools, programming languages).

## Background

Many authors have produced books, papers, websites, and blogs that discuss and explain data visualization. We will summarize their general design concepts in this paper.

## Why Do We Need Data Visualization?

With the explosion of data and tools to analyze it, we need skills to **communicate the message most effectively**.  By applying proven techniques, you can create data visualization that maximizes your audience's absorption of your intended message(s).

## Why Do All Actuaries Need to Learn Data Visualization Basics?

Actuaries excel at analyzing data and drawing conclusions from their work, However **visual communication skills** through graphs, charts, tables, etc. are not on the exam syllabus, nor are they regularly taught or reinforced extensively. Nevertheless, actuaries must _regularly_ communicate complex patterns, trends, conclusions, ideas, and concepts with each other or non-actuarial business partners.

I've always said to myself and others, "We can do the best work with the best data resulting in the best conclusion, but if we can't communicate it effectively, the message is LOST".

With some knowledge and practice, actuaries can create effective data visualization. In this paper, we provide practical tips to make your data visualization sing!

This paper will walk through the basics of data visualization as follows:
* First, we will focus on the audience, those individuals with whom we will be communicating.
* Next, we will review some basic vizualization types and how to choose from among them based on your data and your needs.
* Finally, we will share thoughts about how to design the resultant visualization for maximum impact.
