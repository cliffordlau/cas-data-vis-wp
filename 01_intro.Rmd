# Definition of “Data Visualization”

Visualizations are everywhere. Data and information is becoming more accessible all the time. To absorb value from all this data, we must incorporate the concept of "data visualization". Simply, **data visualization = data represented by a visual image**. Some of the most common and basic data vis applications include bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots. The general design concepts in this publicaion apply to any type of data visualization in any medium (e.g. software (Excel/Powerpoint), programming languages, and websites).

## Background

Many authors have produced books, papers, websites, and blogs on data visualization. We will summarize their general design concepts in this paper.

## Why Do We Need Data Visualization?

With the explosion of data  and tools to analyze it, we need skills to **communicate the message most effectively**. By applying proven techniques, you can create data visualization that maximize your audience's absorption of your intended message(s). 

## Why Do All Actuaries Need to Learn Data Visualization Basics

Actuaries excel at analyzing data and drawing conclusions from their work. However, visual communication skills (i.e., how to make effective graphs, charts, tables, etc.) are not represented on the CAS exam syllabus, nor are they regularly taught or reinforced. Nevertheless, actuaries must _regularly_ communicate complex patterns, trends, conclusions, ideas, and concepts with each other or non-actuarial business partners.

I've always said to myself and others, "We can do the best work with the best data resulting in the best conclusion, but if we can't communicate it effectively, the message is LOST".

With some knowledge and practice, actuaries can create effective data visualization. In this paper, we hope to provide practical tips to make your message clear through data visualization.

This paper will walk through the basics of data visualization as follows: 

* First, we will focus on the **audience**, those individuals with whom we will be communicating. 
* Next, we will review some of the basic **visualization types and how to choose** from among them based on your data and your needs.
* Finally, we will share thoughts about **how to design a visualization** for maximum impact.
