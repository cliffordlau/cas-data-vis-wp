# 4. How to design the visualization

In this section we provide some keys on how to design a data visualization to render a crisp graphic that highlights the message.
Two main techniques described in this section are decluttering to remove what's not needed, and focusing attention to highlight what is crucial.

## 4.1 It is Important to Declutter

Clutter is the enemy in a graphic. Lines, colors, fonts, etc. in default graphic programs tend to be overly busy, and thus do not allow the audience to process the message efficienly. Decluttering data visualizations maximizes the ability to deliver the message effectively.

**4.1.1 Cognitive load** is a concept discussed in [@Knaflic, 2015]. Consuming information takes brain power. A viewer has limits on their short-term working memory. Viewers can only store three to four pieces of information at a time, which means that cluttered and poorly designed data visualizations increase a viewer's 'cognitive load' and reduce what they can retain. It is up to the data visualization designer to create with the audience's cognitive load in mind. Otherwise, the message gets lost altogether, or takes more time and energy to absorb (than they may be willing to expend). Decluttering reduces cognitive load by minimizing what the brain needs to see and process, which enables the reader to see the relevant data more readily. Think "less is more".

**4.1.2 Data-to-Ink Ratio** is a concept discussed in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* [@Tufte, 2001]. This concept means that each dot of 'ink' on the visualization is valuable.  Each dot of ink can be used to describe data, or to clutter a visualization. The author should create data visualizations with a high ratio of data *most relevant* to the message, compared to the amount of 'ink' used for text, lines, borders, or color/shading.

**4.1.3 How to Declutter** - 	Remove the following entirely. Alternatively, or use gray font or line color to tone-down the cognitive load of the following:

* Borders; generally not needed and only obscure key data ink
* Axis lines; the eye automatically sees a line created by the vertical or horizontal labels, or bars
* Gridlines; only keep if they serve a clear purpose
* Axis tick marks; keep the categorical label but remove the horizontal or vertical line marks '-' themselves
* Gray out data or text that is not the *focus* of the visual 
* Use shorter yet descriptive axis-names
* Omit Legends; label data directly 
* Combine the title and the message, or use callout box to clearly share the takeaway message for the reader
		
**Legends** are commonly used in graphs. However, the viewer must move their eyes back and forth from the graphed data to the legend, which takes time and increases cognitive load. If possible, place the label describing the data directly adjacent to the data. Another alternative is to use the same color, weight, line-type, etc. for the text of the data label as for the data itself (direct labeling). This approach may not work for all graph types or for all data. For example, if the lines in a graph are crossing each other, then direct labeling might not work effectively. 

**Y-axis labels** should not use vertical text. It is common to see y-axis labels that are oriented at a 90-degree angle from the x-axis, reading upwards. No one reads naturally this way. Vertical orientation is more difficult to read and is a form of cognitive load; at a minimum it slows down the users ability to quickly identify the axis. Instead, try arranging the vertical-axis label horizontally at the top left of the axis the way we naturally read, or simply include the vertical axis label within the graph title.
		

## 4.2 How to Accentuate to Make the Data ‘Pop’

We have nany tools to draw our viewers attention, and make the data and message stand out. We'll discuss similar two schools of thought on how the human eye and brain perceive our world.

**4.2.1 Gestalt principles** (Gestalt School of Psychology, 1912). These principles have identified how the eyes and brain work to visually connect things together and make sense of our world. The following principles apply:
	
* Proximity
The brain naturally groups together items that are closer together. We can design our data visualizations to direct our viewer to see the patterns or data by placing the relevant items in close proximity.

* Similarity
Objects with similiar size, color, shape, font, or angular orientation are perceived by the brain to be part of the same group. 

* Enclosure
Using some type of border or shading can render data around multiple objects are naturally associated as grouped objects.  

* Continuity
The brain will attempt to enclose things (lines, objects) that aren't even necessarily fully enclosed by a solid line. The brain will likely 'fill in' a dashed line to perceive it as enclosing something if it can be interpreted that way. The brain may perceive a border to exist when objects are lined up; for example, bars lined up along the x-axis could serve as a graph's x-axis border even if the border isn't shown.

* Connection
This principle is commonly used in line graphs to literally 'connect the dots' for the viewer.
	
**4.2.2 Pre-attentive Attributes** [@Few 2012]. The human eye and brain are programmed to perceive a specific set of visual attributes very quickly and with a high rate of accuracy.
	
Attributes of Form

* Length can be quantitatively perceived.
* Width can be quantitatively perceived, but limited in accuracy.
* Size can be quantitatively perceived, but limited in accuracy.
* Shape cannot be quantitatively perceived.
* Orientation in 2D cannot be quantitatively perceived.
* Enclosure cannot be quantitatively perceived.
* Spatial position in 2-Dimensions can be perceived and contrasted in vertical and horizontal position fairly well, in _two_ dimensions. Our brains do _not_ consistently or accurately perceive location in _three_ dimensions as well as two dimensions. This is why 3D graphs are to be avoided.
	
Attributes of Color

* Hue refers to color. Hue can be described by the location on a standard color wheel. Color combinations that work well together, and are distinct enough from one another, can be found on the website ColorBrewer.org.
* Intensity refers to 'fullness' of a color (saturation), and lightness or darkness of a given color.

* Note that _area, volume, angle, and depth are all omitted from the list of preattentive attributes_, since the human eye cannot easily decipher differences in these. This is why we should generaly avoid pie, 3D, area, and bubble charts. There are some exceptions. For exampple, some designers would say it might be ok to use pie charts with only two variables. Some might say that it is ok to use treemap and bubble charts sparingly, but only to show generalities rather than precise differentiation between very similar quantities.

## 4.3 Appendix

Some authors have attempted to rank the efficiency at which the eye can distinguish values, by mode of visualization. 


## 4.3.1 'Hierarchy of Comparisons of Magnitude'
The items at the top of the list reflect the ways that the human eye and brain are most effective at distinguishing values or magnitude.
* Position along common scale
* Position along non-aligned scale
* Direction/Angle
* Area
* Color and shading saturation
* Color hue
* Volume


## 4.3.2 Hierarchy of Identifying Categories
The items at the top of the list reflect the ways that the human eye and brain are most effective at categorizing.
* Spatial Region
* Color
* Motion
* Shape
