# How to design the visualization

In this section, we provide the keys to designing a data visualization that highlights the message.  Some main techniques described in this section are related to:
* decluttering, or removing what's not needed
* accentuating what is crucial.

## It is Important to Declutter

Clutter is the enemy in a graphic. Lines, colors, fonts, etc. in default graphics tend to be overly busy and should be modified. You need to expend effort to declutter data visualization in order to maximize the message.

**Cognitive load** is discussed in [@Knaflic]. Taking in information consumes brain power. A viewer has limits on their short-term working memory. Since viewers can only store three to four chunks of information at a time, cluttered and poorly designed data visualization increases a viewer's 'cognitive load' and reduces what can be retained. The data visualization designer must create with the audience's cognitive load in mind, lest the message will get lost or take away from other information they could absorb. Decluttering reduces cognitive load by minimizing what the brain needs to see and process, enabling the reader to see the message. Think 'less is more'.

**Data-to-Ink Ratio** is discussed in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* [@Tufte2001]. Each dot of 'ink' on the visual is valuable, and can be used to describe data or to clutter a visual. You should create data visualization with a high ratio of ink *most relevant* to the message, compared to the amount of ink used for text, lines, borders, or color/shading.

**How to Declutter** - 	Remove the following entirely, or use gray to tone-down their cognitive load:

* Borders - generally not needed and only clutter data ink from view
* Axis lines - the eye automatically sees a line created by the vertical or horizontal labels, or bars
* Gridlines - only keep if they serve a clear purpose
* Axis tick marks - keep the categorical label but remove the horizontal or vertical line marks '-' themselves
* Gray out data or text that is not the *focus* of the visual 
* Use shorter axis-names
* Omit Legends and label data directly
* Put the message in the Title, or use a callout box to clearly share the takeaway message
		
**Legends** are commonly used in graphs. However, the viewer must move their eyes back and forth from the graphed data to the legend, which takes time and increases cognitive load. If possible, place the label directly adjacent to its data. For the text of the data label, apply the same color, weight, line-type, etc. as used for its data. This approach may not work for all graph types or data (e.g. if the lines in a line graph are crossing each other).

**Y-axis labels** should not use vertical text. It is common to see y-axis labels that are oriented at a 90-degree angle from the x-axis, reading upwards. Who reads this way? Vertical orientation is more difficult to read and is a form of cognitive load; at a minimum it slows down the user's ability to quickly identify the axis. Instead, try arranging the vertical-axis label horizontally at the top left of the axis, or simply include the vertical axis label in the graph title.
		

## How to Accentuate to Make the Data ‘Pop’

We have nany tools to draw our viewers attention

**Gestalt principles** (from the Gestalt School of Psychology, 1912). These principles identify how the brain works to visually connect things together and make sense of our world. The following principles apply:
	
* Proximity - The closer things are together, the brain will naturally group them together. We can design our data visualization to direct the patterns the reader sees.
* Similarity - Objects with similiar size, color, shape, font, or angular orientation are perceived by the brain to be part of the same group.
* Enclosure - Using some type of border or shading can render data to be grouped together. The brain will attempt to enclose things that aren't fully enclosed by a solid line. The brain will 'fill-in' a dashed line to perceive it as enclosing something if it can be interpreted that way.
* Continuity - The brain may perceive a border to exist when objects are lined up (e.g. bars lined up along the x-axis could render a graph's x-axis border).
* Connection - This principle is commonly used in line graphs to literally 'connect the dots' for the viewer. (consider example of 4 dots shown twice; once with vertical lines connecting two dots and another with horizontal lines connecting)
	
**Pre-attentive Attributes** [@Few2012]. The human eye and brain are programmed to perceive a specific set of visual attributes very quickly and with a high rate of accuracy.
	
Attributes of Form

* Length - Can be quantitatively perceived
* Width - Can be quantitatively perceived, but limited in accuracy
* Size - Can be quantitatively perceived, but limited in accuracy
* Shape - Cannot be quantitatively perceived
* Orientation in 2D - Cannot be quantitatively perceived
* Enclosure - Cannot be quantitatively perceived
* Spatial position in 2D - We perceive and contrast vertical and horizontal position fairly well. Our brains do not consistently or accurately perceive location in threee dimensions as well as two dimensions. 3D graphs should be avoided.
	
Attributes of Color

* Hue refers to color. Hue can be described by the location on a standard color wheel. Color combinations that work well together, and are distinct enough from one another, can be found on the website ColorBrewer.org.
* Intensity refers to 'fullness' of a color (saturation), and lightness or darkness of a given color.
		
![Some Examples of Preattentive Attributes](pictures/PAA.png)

* Note that area, volume, angle, and depth are all omitted from preattentive attributes, since the human eye cannot easily decipher differences. This is why we should generaly avoid pie charts, 3D charts, area charts, and bubble charts. There are some exceptions: some designers would say it's ok to use pie charts with only two variables, or to use treemap and bubble charts sparingly.  These charts should only show generalities rather than precise differentiation between quantities.

## Appendix

Some authors have attempted to rank the efficiency at which the eye can distinguish values, by mode of visualization.

Below is a hierarchy of Comparisons of Magnitude:

* Position along common scale
* Position along non-aligned scale
* Direction/Angle
* Area
* Color and Shading saturation
* Color hue
* Volume

Below is a hierarchy of Identifying Categories:

* Spatial Region
* Color
* Motion
* Shape
