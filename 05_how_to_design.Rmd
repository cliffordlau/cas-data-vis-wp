# How to design the visualization

```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
   echo = FALSE

```

In this section we provide some techniques for designing a data visualization to render a crisp graphic that highlights the message.
Two techniques described in this section are:

* **Decluttering** to remove what's not needed, and
* **Accentuating** to highlight what is crucial



## The Importance of Decluttering

Clutter is the enemy in a graphic. Lines, colors, fonts, etc. in default graphics tend to be overly busy. One must expend the effort to declutter data visualizations to maximize the clarity of the message. Below, we describe a few concepts related to decluttering: cognitive load and data-to-ink ratio.


### Cognitive Load

Cognitive load is a concept discussed in [@Knaflic]. Consuming information takes brain power. A viewer has limits on their short-term working memory. Viewers can only store three to four pieces of information at a time, which means that cluttered and poorly designed data visualizations increase a viewer's 'cognitive load' and reduce what they can retain. The data visualization author must design with the audience's cognitive load in mind. Without this consideration, the message gets lost altogether or takes the audience more time and energy to absorb (i.e. more than they may be willing or able to expend). Decluttering reduces cognitive load by minimizing what the brain needs to see and process, which enables the reader to see the relevant data and message more clearly. Think "less is more".


### Data-to-Ink Ratio 

Data-to-ink-ratio is a concept discussed in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* [@Tufte2001]. Each dot of 'ink' on the visualization is valuable, and can be used to either display the data or to clutter a visualization. The author should create data visualizations with a focus on using 'ink' to display data in order to convey the message, compared to the amount of 'ink' used for text, lines, borders, or color/shading.


## How to Declutter

The following aspects of a graph are relatively easy to declutter:

* Borders - delete them since they are generally not needed, and obscure key data ink
* Axis lines - delete them since the eye automatically sees a line created by the vertical or horizontal labels, or bars
* Gridlines - keep only if they serve a clear purpose, otherwise delete
* Axis tick marks - remove the horizontal or vertical line marks '-'
* Gray color - use for data or text that is not the _primary_ focus of the visualization 
* Axis names - use concise yet descriptive names to describe axes
* Titles - combine the title and the message into a single phrase

Other tips to declutter:
**Legends** are commonly used in graphs. However, the viewer must move their eyes back and forth from the graphed data to the legend, which takes time and increases cognitive load. If possible, place the label describing the data directly adjacent to the data. Apply the same color, weight, line-type, etc. for the text of the data label as used for its data (direct labeling). This approach may not work for all graph types or for all data. For example, if the lines in a graph are crossing each other, then direct labeling might not work effectively. 

**Y-axis labels** should not use vertical text. It is common to see y-axis labels that are oriented at a 90-degree angle from the x-axis, reading upwards. No one naturally reads this way. Vertical orientation is more difficult to read and is a form of cognitive load; at a minimum it slows down the reader's ability to quickly identify the axis. Instead, try arranging the vertical-axis label horizontally at the top left of the axis the way we naturally read, or include the vertical axis label within the graph title or a graph footnote.


## How to Accentuate to Make the Data ‘Pop’

We have any tools to draw our viewers attention, and highlight elements that important for message to stand out. We'll discuss two (similar) schools of thought that describe ways that the human eye and brain perceive our world.


###  Gestalt principles

(Gestalt School of Psychology, 1912). These principles identified how the eyes and brain work to visually connect things together and make sense of our world. The following principles apply:
	
* Proximity - The brain naturally groups together items that are closer together. We can design our data visualizations to direct the patterns our viewer sees, by placing the relevant items in close proximity.

* Similarity - Objects with similar size, color, shape, font, or angular orientation are perceived by the brain to be part of the same group. 

* Enclosure - Using some type of border or shading can render data or multiple objects to be associated as grouped objects.  

* Continuity - The brain will attempt to enclose things (lines, objects) that are not fully enclosed by a solid line. The brain will 'fill in' a dashed line to perceive it as enclosing something if it can be interpreted that way. The brain may perceive a border to exist when objects are lined up; for example, bars lined up along the x-axis could serve as a graph's x-axis border even if the border isn't shown.

* Connection - Elements that are visually connected are perceived to be related. This principle is commonly used in line graphs to literally 'connect the dots' for the viewer.


### Pre-attentive Attributes [@Few2012]

The phrase 'quantitatively perceived' means that the human eye and brain are programmed to perceive a specific set of visual attributes very quickly and with a _high rate of accuracy_ as to the quantity expressed by the visual attribute. Some attributes may be quantitatively perceived generally (e.g. area), but the brain and eye cannot be relied to be accurate compared to other attributes. 
	
	
Attributes of Form

* Length 		- can be quantitatively perceived.
* Width 		- can be quantitatively perceived, but limited in accuracy.
* Area & Volume		- *cannot* be quantitatively perceived.
* Spatial position 	- can be perceived and contrasted in vertical and horizontal position fairly well, but only in *two* dimensions not three dimensions
* Shape 		- *cannot* be quantitatively perceived.
* Location in 2-Dimensions- *cannot* be quantitatively perceived.

Attributes of Color

* Hue refers to color. Hue can be described by the location on a standard color wheel. Color combinations that work well together, and are distinct enough from one another, can be found on the website ColorBrewer.org.
* Intensity refers to the 'fullness' of a color (saturation), and lightness or darkness of a given color.

Below are some examples of how pre-attentive attributes could be used to distinguish and compare values or objects.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/PREATTENTIVE_ATTRIBUTES.PNG')
```
		
* Note that _area, volume, angle, and depth are all omitted from the list of pre-attentive attributes_, since the human eye cannot easily decipher differences in these. This is why we should generally avoid pie, 3D, area, and bubble charts. There are some exceptions. For example, some designers say it might be OK to use pie charts with only two variables. Others might say that it is OK to use treemap and bubble charts sparingly, to show generalities rather than precise differentiation between very similar quantities.


## Before-and-After Example of Data Visualization

In the two graphs below, we show a *before* and *after* version of a graph.


**Before we've applied data visualization basic techniques** using default settings, we can hardly see the data, and we certainly cannot tell what the message is or even what to focus on.

```{r }
knitr::include_graphics('figures/market_share_left.png')
```

* Too many border and axis lines, and the gridlines actually *hide* the lines representing the data
* Too many Y-axis labels, the color is too dark and/or lines are too thick, all draw our attention away from the data and increase cognitive load
* Color is used to differentiate the lines, and while they are color-coded with the legend, they each have bright colors so it isn't clear where to focus
* The legend requires the eye to look back and forth from the data lines to the legend
* The title is long and cumbersome, and we still don't know what the message is




**After we have applied basic data visualization techniques** we can clearly tell what the message is from the title and color choices. The axis amounts and the other states' information is visible but given less emphasis with gray or muted color.

```{r }
knitr::include_graphics('figures/market_share_right.png')
```

* No gridlines, border, or axis lines. 
* Fewer Y-axis labels; still allowing for reference for the lines
* Color is used to differentiate the lines, but muted tones for other states and darker for the focus state.
* The legend is omitted entirely, rather each line is direct-labeled
* The title tells the reader what the message is, and uses color-matching with the line and line label.

Which graph would you rather see as a viewer? With some effort and knowledge, you can see dramatic improvements in delivering the message, while reducing the cognitive load of the viewer.
